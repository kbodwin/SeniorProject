Intro
========================

Column {data-width=650}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

### introduction {.no-title}

A binomial experiment is an experiment satisfying the following conditions. 

1.	There is a fixed number of trials, denoted by n.
2.	A trial has only two possible outcomes: a “success” or a “failure.”
3.	The trials of the experiment are independent of each other (if the outcome of one trial is a “success,” then the chance that another outcome is a “success” is not influenced).
4.	The probability of observing a “success” on each trial remains the same, denoted by p. We denote the probability of a “failure” by q = 1 – p. 

In general, a binomial random variable is a random variable that represents the number of “successes” in n trials.

If a random variable follows a binomial distribution we write it as: X~Binomial(n, p)

This applet will go over three funtions to help you with the binomial process: <br>
**dbinom** will calculate the probability of a given number of successes <br>
**pbinom** will calculate the probability of less than or equal to a given number of successes <br>
**qbinom** lets us work our way backward to find the number of successes for a given probability <br>
^ should fix qbinom to mention that it's that it's a range of successes
*add binomial example*

**NOTES**
- only one practice problem shows up
- practice problems won't take code or answers
- layout of each isn't quite what i wanted (may make sense to take it out of flexdashboard bc it's a little limiting)

Column {data-width=350}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

### viz
i think it'd be cool to provide some sort of visual here
this could be a comparison of the three functions where students are able to click through or maybe just an illustration to help with concept of binomial
```{r}

```


dbinom
===========================

Column {.tabset}
--------------------------

### Create your own binomial distribution!

The first important function is `dbinom()`, which finds the *probability* of some number of successes.

```{r factor_var}
textInput("n",
          "How many trials do you have?",
          value = "0",
          width = '80%', placeholder = NULL)
textInput("p",
          "What is the probability of success at each trial?",
          value = "0",
          width = '80%', placeholder = NULL)
textInput("k",
          "We are interested in the probability of how many successes?",
          value = "0",
          width = '80%', placeholder = NULL)
bs_1_1 = reactive("dbinom(%ni, size = %ni, prob = %ni)")
```

```{r, context="server"}
output$code_1_1 <- renderText(
        makePrintText(
          base_string = bs_1_1(),
          old_input = c(),
          new_input = c(input$k, input$n, input$p)
        )
  )
output$output_1_1 <- renderPrint({
 eval(parse(text = 
    makeEvalText(
      base_string = bs_1_1(), 
      old_input = c(),
      new_input = c(input$k, input$n, input$p)
    )
   ))
})
output$binom_var_1 <- renderText(
        makePrintText(
          base_string = "X ~ Binomial(%ni, %ni) \n P(X = %ni) = ?",
          old_input = c(),
          new_input = c(input$n, input$p, input$k)
        )
  )
output$distn_1 <- renderPlot(
  illustrate_binom(input$n, input$p, x = input$k, equal_to = TRUE)
)
```


### Practice Problems
*not all questions show up* (and it won't take any sort of input/run the code)

In the box below, you may run any line of **R** code.  Use the box, and/or the exercise above, to answer the following questions.

```{r ex_1-1, exercise = TRUE}
```

```{r q_1}
textInput("a_1.1",
           "I flip 30 fair coins.  What is the probability that I get exactly 15 tails?",
           value = "",
           width = '80%', placeholder = NULL)
htmlOutput("check_1.1")
textInput("a_1.2",
           "16% of all Starburst candies in a pack are cherry flavored.  What is the probability that in a pack of 12, I get exactly 4 cherry Starbursts?",
           value = "",
           width = '80%', placeholder = NULL)
htmlOutput("check_1.2")
textInput("a_1.3",
           "In an upcoming election, 40% of voters prefer Candidate A, and 60% prefer Candidate B.  If only 16 people vote, what is the probability that the vote is NOT tied?",
           value = "",
           width = '80%', placeholder = NULL)
htmlOutput("check_1.3")
```

```{r, context = "server"}
output$check_1.1 <- renderText(
  if(input$a_1.1 == ""){
     ""
  }else if(round(input$a_1.1,2) == round(dbinom(15, 30, .5), 2)){
      correct
  }else{
    incorrect
  }
)
output$check_1.2 <- renderText(
  if(input$a_1.2 == ""){
     ""
  }else if(round(input$a_1.2,2) == round(dbinom(4, 12, 0.16), 2)){
      correct
  }else{
    incorrect
  }
)
output$check_1.3 <- renderText(
  if(input$a_1.3 == ""){
     ""
  }else if(round(input$a_1.3,2) == round(1- dbinom(8, 16, 0.4), 2)){
      correct
  }else{
    incorrect
  }
)
```

pbinom
===========================

Column {data-width=650}{.tabset}
--------------------------

### What does pbinom look like?

*rephrase the evidence bit, the or more part will probably be confusing because it's the opposite of pbinom*
It is not very common that we are interested in the probability of some exact number of successes.
More often, we want to quantify **evidence** by finding the probability of some number **or more** of successes.  For this, we will use *pbinom()*.  By default, `pbinom()` finds the probability of getting **less than or equal to** the given number.  Try it below.


```{r pbinom2}
textInput("n2",
          "How many trials do you have?",
          value = "0",
          width = '80%', placeholder = NULL)
textInput("p2",
          "What is the probability of success at each trial?",
          value = "0",
          width = '80%', placeholder = NULL)
textInput("k2",
          "We are interested in the probability of less than or equal to how many successes?",
          value = "0",
          width = '80%', placeholder = NULL)
bs_1_2 = reactive("pbinom(%ni, size = %ni, prob = %ni)")
```

```{r, context="server"}
output$code_2 <- renderText(
        makePrintText(
          base_string = bs_1_2(),
          old_input = c(),
          new_input = c(input$k2, input$n2, input$p2)
        )
  )
output$output_2 <- renderPrint({
 eval(parse(text = 
    makeEvalText(
      base_string = bs_1_2(), 
      old_input = c(),
      new_input = c(input$k2, input$n2, input$p2)
    )
   ))
})
output$binom_var_2 <- renderText(
        makePrintText(
          base_string = "X ~ Binomial(%ni, %ni) \n P(X ≤ %ni) = ?",
          old_input = c(),
          new_input = c(input$n2, input$p2, input$k2)
        )
  )
output$distn_2 <- renderPlot(
  illustrate_binom(input$n2, input$p2, x = input$k2)
)
```

### Practice Problems
display empty line of code like how it starts on current applet
space for r code mess around
handful of problems
include lower.tail info and a question about it -> input r code as an answer (so they know they could use 1- or lower.tail = F)
```{r ex_2, exercise = TRUE}
```

```{r q_2}
textInput("a_2.1",
           "I flip 30 fair coins.  What is the probability that I get less than half tails?",
           value = "",
           width = '80%', placeholder = NULL)
htmlOutput("check_2.1")
textInput("a_2.2",
           "16% of all Starburst candies in a pack are cherry flavored.  What is the probability that in a pack of 12, I get more than 4 cherry Starbursts?",
           value = "",
           width = '80%', placeholder = NULL)
htmlOutput("check_2.2")
textInput("a_2.3",
           "About 10% of all humans are left-handed.  If I randomly choose 43 humans, what is the probability that at least 8 of them are left handed?",
           value = "",
           width = '80%', placeholder = NULL)
htmlOutput("check_2.3")
```

```{r, context = "server"}
output$check_2.1 <- renderText(
  if(input$a_2.1 == ""){
     ""
  }else if(round(input$a_2.1,2) == round(pbinom(14, 30, .5), 2)){
      correct
  }else{
    incorrect
  }
)
output$check_2.2 <- renderText(
  if(input$a_2.2 == ""){
     ""
  }else if(round(input$a_2.2,2) == round(1-pbinom(4, 12, 0.16), 2)){
      correct
  }else{
    incorrect
  }
)
output$check_2.3 <- renderText(
  if(input$a_2.3 == ""){
     ""

qbinom
===========================

Column {data-width=650}{.tabset}
--------------------------

### What does qbinom look like?
*reword in reverse bit*
Finally, sometimes we want to ask probability questions "in reverse".  For example, we might ask "If I flip 100 coins, I can be 95% sure that I will get at least how many tails?".  We could answer this via guess-and-check with `pbinom()`, but fortunately, there is a function for it in **R** called `qbinom()`.

*last input needs to be fixed cuz it's hard to understand*
```{r qbinom}
textInput("n3",
          "How many trials do you have?",
          value = "0",
          width = '80%', placeholder = NULL)
textInput("p3",
          "What is the probability of success at each trial?",
          value = "0",
          width = '80%', placeholder = NULL)
textInput("q",
          "We want to find the number of successes that has a probability of ____ below it.",
          value = "0",
          width = '80%', placeholder = NULL)
bs_3 = reactive("qbinom(%ni, size = %ni, prob = %ni)")
```

```{r, context="server"}
output$code_3 <- renderText(
        makePrintText(
          base_string = bs_3(),
          old_input = c(),
          new_input = c(input$q, input$n3, input$p3)
        )
  )
output$output_3 <- renderPrint({
 eval(parse(text = 
    makeEvalText(
      base_string = bs_3(), 
      old_input = c(),
      new_input = c(input$q, input$n3, input$p3)
    )
   ))
})
output$binom_var_3 <- renderText(
        makePrintText(
          base_string = "X ~ Binomial(%ni, %ni) \n P(X ≤ ?) = %ni",
          old_input = c(),
          new_input = c(input$n3, input$p3, input$q)

Extra Problems
==================

Column {data-width=1000}
-------------------

A good habit to get into when coding is to "translate" your code to English in your head, and try to predict what the output will be.  This is how to figure out if you are truly asking the computer to calculate what you hoped.  (Remember - computers will almost always output *something*!  It is your responsibility as the scientist to make sure you have asked the right question.)

For the following, try to guess what the output would be.  Do **not** run the code; instead, try to read it as a probability question and think through the answer.

*Give answers to 2 decimals*

```{r q_4}
textInput("a_4.1",
           "dbinom(1, size = 1, prob = 0.7)",

htmlOutput("check_4.2")
textInput("a_4.4",
           "qbinom(1, size = 60, prob = 0.13)",
           value = "",
           width = '80%', placeholder = NULL)

textInput("a_4.3",
           "pbinom(50, size = 100, prob = 0.5)",

htmlOutput("check_4.3")
textInput("a_4.5",
           "qbinom(0.5, size = 100, prob = 0.5)",
           value = "",
           width = '80%', placeholder = NULL)
